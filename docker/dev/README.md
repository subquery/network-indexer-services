## Dev environment

To change the default values, copy the `.env.example` file as `.env`, and change any value as needed.
And there is one value must be changed: LOCAL_IP.

To start dev environment, run `bash docker/dev/1_install.sh` to install node modules and `bash docker/dev/2_start.sh` to start the dev server.
